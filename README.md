Examining Mental Health in the Technology Industry

The goal of this project is to examine how an organization, specifically in the technology sector, response to mental health affects their employees.

This will be done by answering the questions: 
- what is the relationship between mental health/illnesses and employee performance in the workplace?
-  How does treatment/remote work affect employee performance?
- What can be the causes of mental health in the workplace, do lack of benefits/ employer resources influence this?
- What are some descriptive attributes about the organization that can influence mental health, such as size, location, etc. ?
- Examine the role anonymity plays in terms of mental health and productivity.

The first stage of the project was data cleaning as outlined in the descriptive statistics R file. The second involving the actual analysis is done on python as seen in the ipynb file. The third will be conducting the analyses and adjusting the models to ensure accuracy and relevance. Finally, the models will be run and a report will be written. 

Included in the Github repository are the abstract and literature review reports created for this project.
