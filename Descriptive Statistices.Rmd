## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
wpmhdata <- mental_heath_in_tech_2016_20161114
#DATA CLEANING
#removed unneeded columns
wpmhdata <- subset(wpmhdata, select = -c(1,4,8,17,18,19,20,21,22,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,46,47,49,50,52,62))

#renamed columns to make the data easier to read
eztitles <- c('self-employed','No. of Employees at org', 'tech/nontech', 'provide mh benefits', 'knowledge of mh care options from employer', 'employer discussed mh resources', 'anonymity protected when using mh services', 'requesting mh leave', 'discussing mh leads to negative consequences', 'discussing physical health leads to negative consequences', 'comfortable discussing mh w/ coworker', 'comfortable discussing mh w/ direct supervisor', 'physical health taken more seriously', 'heard of negative consequences for coworkers who discussed mh', 'productivity affected', '% productivity affected by mh', 'self-identifing hurts career', 'coworker view you negative if mh', 'willing to share with f/f about mh', 'seen or had badly handled response to mh issues in current or previous',  'seeing what happened to others - less likely to reveal', 'currently have mh disorder', 'diagnosed by mhc by medical professional', 'sought treatment', 'if mh, interferes with work when treated', 'if mh, interferes with work when not treated', 'age', 'sex', 'country reside in','US State reside in', 'country work in', 'US State work in', 'remote work')
colnames(wpmhdata) <- eztitles
```


```{r}
#Observing the Data
head(wpmhdata)
str(wpmhdata)
